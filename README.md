# About Model

This is a comprehensive supply chain simulation model in the pharmaceutical industry. This model integrates all key stakeholders, including pharmaceutical suppliers, distributors, retailers, doctors, and patients, within a dynamic environment. It allows for the examination of various scenarios and their impact on supply chain dynamics. One clear application is the analysis of the whiplash effect in the supply chain. The whiplash effect, also known as the bullwhip effect, is a phenomenon where small changes in demand at the retail level cause increasingly larger fluctuations as they propagate up the supply chain to the wholesaler and manufacturer levels.
